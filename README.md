# operating-system

We build this multiprogramming operating system using C++ language. 
We can give it jobs with code for printing * in any shape, performing mathematical calculations, string operations like reverse the string.
Jobs may have program errors like  Out of Data, Line Limit Exceeded, Time Limit Exceeded,  Operation Code Error, Operand Error, Invalid Page Fault.
PI interrupt for program errors introduced
There will not be physical separation between two jobs. 
Job outputs will be separated in the output file by 2 blank lines.
We have implemented concepts of Operating Syteme like paging, page table stored in real memory, Program pages allocated one of 30 memory block using random number generator.
Load and run one program at a time.
